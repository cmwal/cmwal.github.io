# Derf 150G Vertical Drum Spinner

## Derf V4

In this iteration I worked on increasing the structural rigidity of the chassis due to the lack of torque resistance in the v3 iteration. The introduction of inward curving walls helps distribute the blow of horizontal spinners, which accounts for most instances of bots in this weight class.
